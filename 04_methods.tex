Another step is creating program in image analysis, it was writen in Python.
There were used several Python libraries, most of segmentation methods were
implemented using Scikit image library, there were also used opencv for Python
and Scipy ndimage for some functions, these libraries are using Numpy, which
is library used for work with martices. There was also used Matplotlib Pyplot
library for plotting and saving images.

First step after loading TEM image is convering it into grayscale due it could
be filtrated.
