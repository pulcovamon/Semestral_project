The goal of the project is to create program for automatic determination of sizes and shape of nanoparticles and nanorods from TEM images. Particular goals are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Prepare TEM samples with nanoparticles and nanorods.
  \item Get TEM images of nanoparticles and nanorods.
  \item Suggest proper segmentation method for TEM images.
  \item Create Python program for automatic analysis.
  \item Make GUI for the program.
\end{itemize}
